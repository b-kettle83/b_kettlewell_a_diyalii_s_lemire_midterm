<h2>Why Action is #1</h2>
<body>
    <p>
        When someone goes to the movies they end up seeing a larger ratio of action movies compared to any other. That is because movie directors understand that their target audience eats it up. Many action movies can be for any target group, such as kids, adults, or elderly. By example: Spider-man is a favourite to many children around the world. Then there’s even movies for a man’s wife that might’ve preferred to watch a rom-com, such as Fallout. Action involves some teamwork with other genres such as comedy, drama, and even romance. Action movies are the pinnacle of anticipation, excitement and adrenaline. When watching in 3D it even feels like you’re experiencing the movie as if you are a character in it. It becomes so enticing that you get caught up in the movie and the whole experience. Although Comedy and Drama can be great genres to watch, they don't give off as much of an adrenaline rush of happiness while watching. Comedy is great for a laugh and drama makes you think about your own self. But to escape from that, Action is the way to go.
