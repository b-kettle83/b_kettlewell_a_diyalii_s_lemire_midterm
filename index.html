    <h1>Comedy vs Action vs Drama: A Truly Cinematic Battle</h1>

        <h2>Why Comedy Is The Greatest</h2>

        <p>When you’re watching a movie, you’re there to relax and have fun for one 
        reason or another. Some people get their enjoyment from being scared, or 
        from intense sequences, but everybody can find enjoyment in laughter and 
        just having a good time. Action and drama are very intense genres of 
        movies, which while they may have a time and place, they aren’t as usable 
        options or as widely available to the viewer as a comedy movie might be, 
        whereas with comedy, everyone can always use a laugh. Also, comedy is 
        something nearly everybody will enjoy with friends or family, while 
        something like action or drama asks for a more particular taste that 
        not everybody will have. Comedy can furthermore help lift spirits and 
        weaken the bad things going on by giving an opportunity to just be in the 
        moment and laugh, and as the saying goes, laughter is the best medicine.</p>
